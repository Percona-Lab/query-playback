Description: A tool for replaying captured database server load
 Percona Playback is a tool for replaying the captured load of one database
 server against another in the most realistic way possible. Captured load can
 come in the form of MySQL slow query logs or tcpdump capture.
 It's multithreaded, modular and configurable to allow for flexibility and
 future extension.
